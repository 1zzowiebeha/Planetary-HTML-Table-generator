Add testing via pytest

Add a CI/CD pipeline to include pytest, mypy|pytype|pyright|pylance|pyre
    https://www.infoworld.com/article/2260170/4-python-type-checkers-to-keep-your-code-clean.html

Add a test coverage badge for the README

Render tbody data in a hard-coded fashion, where the CSV file specifies headers the data is attached to,
and the row-spanning headers already exist within the template.
    CSV will clarify what the data the record holds via named columns.

    When all is complete, make it work with any number of [optionally row-spanning] headers.
    Achieve row-spanning parent headers via a CSV file w/ optional header name/rowspan/colspan columns.

Refactor settings to a settings.py file
Refactor Template to a /core/ package

Fix broken table styling at small screen sizes
    CSS Grid to the rescue!
    
    For the time being,
    Create fixed-width scrollable overflow table on mobile

Take data from a SQLite database
    Or maybe a document DB given that there's no relationships
    ... other than headings.

Fix pseudo-element underline bug when links wrap

Prettify rendered HTML with tabs before/after write to maintain HTML document formatting
