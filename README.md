## About:

Adapted from MDN's [accessible table example](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Planet_data_table).

Takes a data file containing planetary data such as name, density, distance from the sun, etc.
and converts it into a highly semantic HTML table for data visualization.
